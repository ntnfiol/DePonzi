# DePonzi
Blockchain based Ponzi Game

We decentralized a Ponzi finacial experimentation on the TRON network, named DePonzi. Unlike the traditional Ponzi scram are centralized, hollowing out and withdrawal denied are inevitation in the end, DePonzi using smart contract implement the rule on the blockchain, once the contract has been published, everyone following the rules forced, even the contract creator.

DePonzi are opensource and verified by Tronscan, due to hollowing out risk are logically does not exist,  you can think of its as pure bubble economy. In this project, better than that, we design a time interval deposit mechanism to restrict contract deposit amount in every 15 minutes interval to reduce the risk of run on a bank.
